  <summary><h3>Chapter 1: Everything is a Character</h3></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <code>var anything = new Character({...})</code><br/>
    From the backgrounds to collision blocks, NPCs and player characters, 
    everything you see on the game screen is created using a character object.
    The Character object is defined in characters.js and contains data that is used by the game engine to decide the characters state or behaviour on screen.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <code>'name':'mario'</code><br/>
    Like mario, block or powerup, it's a character's name.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'x':50</code><br/>
    The horizontal position, visible from 0 (left) to the value of the screen width (right).
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'y':50</code><br/>
    The vertical position, visible from 0 (top) to the value of the screen height (bottom).
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'width':100</code><br/>
    The horizontal span, drawn from the value of x (50) to to this value of the width (100).
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'height':100</code><br/>
    The vertical span, drawn from the value of y (50) to to this value of the height (100).
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'direction':90</code><br/>
    The clockwise angle around its imaginary z-axis, in degrees 0/360 (up) to 90 (right), to 180 (down), to 270 (left).  
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'speed':0</code><br/>
    The starting and current speed, how much it changes its position by.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'angspeed':0</code><br/>
    The starting and current angular speed, how much it changes its direction/angle by.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'maxspeed':10</code><br/>
    The maximum speed allowed or possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'minspeed':0</code><br/>
    The minimum speed allowed or possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>'link':'https://link-to-image'</code><br/>
    Link to the image that that visually represents this, could be a jpeg or png or animated gif.

  <summary><h3>Chapter 2: Acting in a Loop</h3></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <code>var gameLoop = () => {...}</code><br/>
    Every character is repeatedly drawn on the screen using the data you have set in it's object. The game is made by you changing or using that data. I have provided some functions that i think will help you save time (i guess that's what a game engine is).

  <summary><h3>Chapter 3: According to Events</h3></summary>
  <blockquote>
    <pre><code>
      //Events
      if(condition){...}
    </code></pre><br/>
    The character remains the same as it is drawn repeatedly, unless something changes.
    Events are what check for this change in character. Games are a battlefield of events.
