<p>
  <code>var anything = new Character({...})</code>
  Everything you see on the game screen is a defined using a character object.
  The Character object is defined in characters.js and contains data that is used by the game engine to decide the characters state or behaviour on screen. Let's have a deeper look at the keys it's made up of.

    <b>name</b>
    Like mario or sonic, it's a characters name.

  <p>
    <b>x</b>
    The horizontal position of your character, visible from 0 (left) to the value of the screen width (right).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>y</b>
    The vertical position of your character, visible from 0 (top) to the value of the screen height (bottom).
